 * Question 1: Do I have disease X?
 * X can be: "Food poisoning", "Chronic kidney disease", 
 * "Cold sore", "Chickenpox", or "Diarrhoea"
 * 
 * For this question, has_disease(X) will be true
 * if forall(has_symptom(disease(X), Y, _), ask_for_symptom(Y)) is true, then
 * disease(X) must be true. Modus Ponens is being used: 
 * if p (for all..), then q (has_disease). p, therefore, q.

/*
 * Question 2: Does disease Y contain a common symptom that occurs 
 * with every disease included in this system?
 * Y can be: "Food poisoning", "Chronic kidney disease", 
 * "Cold sore", "Chickenpox", or "Diarrhoea"
 * 
 * For every common symptom of disease Y, it is being checked whether that
 * symptom is also a symptom for all the other diseases in the set(universal).
 * If so, that means that there is a common symptom, and the question will respond
 * with that symptom. Conjunction is being used.

/*
 * Question 3: Can disease Y lead to another disease?
 * Y can be: "Food poisoning", "Chronic kidney disease", 
 * "Cold sore", "Chickenpox", or "Diarrhoea"
 * 
 * According to our facts, it is possible for a disease to be a symptom for
 * another disease in the set. To check this, each disease is being looped through to see
 * if it can be a symptom of another disease(Pay attention to Y, which is the disease that
 * is being checked as a symptom in has_symptom), Conjunction is being used.

/*
 * Question 4: Since I know the unique symptom and the possible diseases I have,
 * would I have disease X or disease Y?
 * Y and X can be: "Food poisoning", "Chronic kidney disease", 
 * "Cold sore", "Chickenpox", or "Diarrhoea". Diarrhoea will always be false because
 * it does not have any unique symptom, and it is assumed the user knows
 * the unique symptom, he/she can never have Diarrhoea.
 * 
 * Since our database knows which symptoms are unique, we can eliminate
 * one of the two diseases since we know the unique symptom and the possible diseases.
 * Conjunction and Elimination are being used here.

 * Question 6: Does a medicine of disease X help against disease Y? 
 * For  this to be true, disease Y has to be a symptom of disease X.
 * First, the system checks whether there is a disease X for medicine Z. 
 * Then, it checks whether there is a disease Y that is a symptom for
 * disease X. The system then confirms that medicine Z could be used for disease X. 
 * This is done using the 
 * rules of inference: Transivity.  
 * if medicine, then disease X
 * if disease X, then disease Y
 * therefore, if medicine, then disease Y
